    <p>Bacon is a hateful thing to cook. Someone said, "Poverty is the worst form of violence." I do not know who said this but as long as pigs exist, they are wrong. Of course you have to embrace pain to inherit gain. Find strength to push through when the bacon strikes.</p>
    <h1>Ingrediants</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Stove</li>
        <li>Courage to Embrace Pain</li>
        <li>Pan</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat Stove <em>(idk pretty hot)</em></li>
        <li>Put Bacon Strips on Heated Pan</li>
        <li>Wait a Few Minutes</li>
        <li>Flip</li>
        <li>Repeat Step 3</li>
        
    </ol>
    <p>To this day i cannot decide if cooking bacon is worth the risk of losing an eye to grease splatter.</p>
